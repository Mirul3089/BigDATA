# Hospital-Readmission-Prediction

• Performed Explanatory Data Analysis and applied extensive feature engineering, feature selection and on Diabetes patient’s hospital readmission data.

• Built Decision Tree, Random Forest and Logistic classifiers in python using Scikit-Learn to predict which patients might be readmitted to the hospital.

• Applied cross validation on the training data to select the best parameters of the model.

• Determined the model’s performance by comparing recall and precision on test data to choose the best Machine
Learning Algorithm.
